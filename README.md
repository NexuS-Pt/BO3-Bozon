## How to download

Because we are using submodules for this project, Github doesn't allow to fully download the project. Because of that, you can use a flag in git to recursively download everything to your PC.

Open your Terminal, and move the cursor to a folder of your choice, *eg.: Downloads*:

```shell
cd ~/Downloads
git clone --recursive https://github.com/One-Shift/BO3-BOzon.git my_new_project_folder
```

A new folder called to *my_new_project_folder* will be created will all repository of BO3, including default submodules.
